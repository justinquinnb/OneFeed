# What is OneFeed
*The Free Feed Aggregator*
## About
OneFeed is a free content aggregation service I intend to use in my portfolio revamp, which is coming soonâ„¢. It provides a single set of endpoints to fetch an aggregation of content from (theoretically) any social media feed. 
OneFeed will automatically remodel feed content into a single data structure for easy presentation on any site, creating a free solution for displaying your latest activity in an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize manner.

## Plans
Ultimately, the goal is to build this project such that others can fork it and self-host the service, democratizing the otherwise very pricey realm of content aggregation platforms. While I am currently developing this as a 
purpose-built tool for my site alone, I will continue developing this into a highly customizable service with a plugin architecture. Users can then download content source plugins of their choosing, developed by myself or 
others online. Drop in the .jars, add your API keys, and your interfaces will immediately begin displaying content from your desired sources.

## Current Status
This project is currently in development, and I (like just about every other dev) hope to build this with a relatively quick turnaround. At the moment, I'm building it specifically for use in my portfolio site. As soon as 
that's live, I'll begin implementing the plugin functionality so the tool can be used by others with ease.

# Forking
See above! We're not there quite yet ðŸ˜….
