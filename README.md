# What is OneFeed
*The Free Feed Aggregator*
## About
OneFeed is a free content aggregation service I intend to use in my portfolio revamp, which is coming soonâ„¢. It provides a single set of endpoints to fetch an aggregation of content from (theoretically) any social media or content feed. 
OneFeed will automatically remodel feed content into a single data structure for easy presentation on any site, creating a free solution for displaying your latest activity in an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize manner.

## Plans
Ultimately, the goal is to build this project such that others can customize and self-host the service with ease, democratizing the otherwise very pricey realm of content aggregation services. Defining features in this vein include plug-and-play feed additions, configurable handling and presentation of text formatting, and the ability to map content produced by any source into any arbitrary, uniform (or non-uniform) model desired.

## Current Status
This project is currently in development, and I (like just about every other dev) hope to build this with a relatively quick turnaround. ~~At the moment, I'm building it specifically for use in my portfolio site. As soon as 
that's live, I'll begin implementing the plugin functionality so the tool can be used by others with ease.~~ The **GOAL** is to 1.0 sometime around or before mid-May this year. Since nobody is eagerly awaiting this app's launch (as far as I'm aware of ðŸ˜…), expect delays should achieving a sufficiently polished, stable, and feature-rich app require a little extra time in the oven. As it's easier to develop OneFeed with customization and extensibility as a priority from the get-go, the current development approach should mean that the version ready for me is also ready for others.
